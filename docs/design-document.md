### Nice Cream Design Document

#### Problems with Paprika
 - No web version
 - Lack of organization features. Organization should be visual and require little thought.
 - Clunky, text-heavy UI (UGLY)
 - Common workflows are not streamlined (ex. it requires pasting a url, clicking a button, waiting for the page to load, then clicking another button just to download a recipe)
 - Requires a separate license per platform
 - Recipe scaling does not always work
 - Ingredients and instructions cannot be on the same page
 - Does not save progress in recipe after leaving the recipe

#### Project Goals
 - Web-first potentially with mobile apps
 - Easy to use, visual organization features
 - Quality typography and page layout for recipe viewing
   - Beautiful interface that resembles a cookbook 
 - Sharing
 - Streamlined recipe import process
   - Automatic import from URL; it can also detect URLs in your clipboard and prompt you to import it
   - Sharing from a different app (Chrome, Safari, etc)
   - Accessibility import option: search for recipes through Google, and open up a browser that can then import recipes
 - Shopping List functionality: automatically build a shopping list based on recipes you're making

#### Components
- Menus
  - Categorized List of Recipes
- Recipe View
