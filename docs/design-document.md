### Nice Cream Design Document

Problems with Paprika
 - No web version
 - Lack of organization features. Organization should be visual and require little thought.
 - Clunky, text-heavy UI
 - Common workflows are not streamlined (ex. it requires pasting a url, clicking a button, waiting for the page to load, then clicking another button just to download a recipe)
 - Requires a separate license per platform
 - Recipe scaling does not always work
 - Ingredients and instructions cannot be on the same page

Project Goals
 - Web-first potentially with mobile apps
 - Easy to use, visual organization features
 - Quality typography and page layout for recipe viewing
 - Sharing
